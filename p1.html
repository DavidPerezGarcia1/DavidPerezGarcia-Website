         <h5> Exercise 1 </h5>
		<p>
      My main goal for exercise 1 is to create a very random but very colorful sketch from top to bottom. First step I take is to heavily play around the randomize tool, from making random colors of different shakes and movement/changing shapes. I create arcs which form into a circle, start to create movement like a pacman in the wane of opening and closing the circle frame by frame. The whole row of the circle is not the same, each has separate time of movement, so I don't have one single timing. I made usages of code square,random, two different loops with different colors, which form into pixels. As well with console.logs and if statements to create different sections for each unique output, and of course removing/mixing code from wide range to filing shapes,size, frame rate and let’s commands. For example, loop commands of continuous change of color of rect on left side and top side of the screen. So overall I make a bunch of different outcomes with different layouts to form a cool look but random.

      For this next sketch, my main focus is to gain and use all of the functions of the key press from movement,active, as well force on fonts, global,local and tracking counts/reset. I use many images input for layout all over the screen but as well for moving keys, like two different versions. I made use of global variables to teach each movement of movement images, as well for active push, as well as none movement image with tint color over it. Also of course lot’s of keybind press, mouse movement and even mix use other colors in a way. I made use of fonts for the main green words effect with one don't, but for red words, I use 3 different fonts, which have different movements to see clearly of each font. Uses of movement effects when moving mouses it changes color. It’s almost like pressing a lot of stuff using a cool/random type of stuff. Each part you see is so much different but at the same time it is all linked up to one, being able to highlight everything, which gives a weird but cool look.

         <h5> Project 1</h5>
		<p>
      Throughout project 1, I have one big goal, which is to make the most weird and unlikely brush to use but at the same time very nice to use, which builds up into a weird and nice brush together. Of course I have chosen a brush template to get my goals done. Each of my brushes have their own unique style, which brings out many different ways to use the brush itself. Also can be complex in a way if the user wants a certain movement and shape from the brush. From all angles and movement from each of 3 brushes, it is much different but at the same time it’s almost similar in a way. The way I achieve in my opinion is to break everything. If it normally works, I break the code again and again, over and over again. For example, make a triangle that normally has 6 input of number row, into an input that rect normally has which is 4 input of number. Which is why I find success for project one, being able to redo many times to see different outcomes, to get the weird/cool brush I wanted at the end. The biggest problem/challenge I face is being able to have the unpredictable brush I wanted but at the same time being able to use that brush to use in actual drawing. I have faced many issues of having unpredictable brush but not really good use for drawing. Which is why I can heavily improve by knowing the in and outs of which input of code will break but in time why will it break in that certain way, like more about rotation, counts inside of a shape and outcome of flipping the number with negative. Bring out more of my brush of not only being just brush to move around normally, but making brush super active from movement of brush and each placement of where it is.The art style is not really one style In my opinion, but overall is mostly an abstract style. Overall subject matter I believe is mostly creating unpredictable art, leaning more towards abstract art, popping out, right in your face(if that makes sense).
