         <h5> Exercise 3 </h5>
		<p>
            My overall action I took for exercise 3 is pretty much wanting to take time taking example of spacebug and death star to form “evolution” of it in my own style/way different to the original. I made more into  aliens like centipedes by having many bodies,legs/fingers, eyeballs that have cool eyes on each of them, that stand out a lot in my opinion. Also the overall layout is wild/random but all tie up together at the end with the layout of how I wanted.
      <br>
      During the program, there will be two different types of centipede, one that is longer and more colorful, the other is less length and less color from the other one. Which layout is simply pasted in canvas to move with moon/sun ball and mouse movement, which fall under bounce functions/speed of movement speed of each ball,area of where ball bounces and translation(). I heavily made use of angle() and rotate() in almost every part of the creature itself from body shapes to eyes details, from head to toe. For the child function, I made a smaller centipede tail eating a color circle and for the longer centipede is holding a toy sword, which stands out more between both. Which bring in different scale factors from centipede paste on canvas to centipede on the mouse which make spiral shape. Overall, I believe I did well on this assignment of really pushing the limits for most functions from making and breaking, especially using rotate(may have used too much for my own good)(function name in "run").
<br>


Another comment I have is I struggle a lot personally on making sure conflict does not happen between different types of rotation. From doing too much rotation that is needed for simple action and as well over doing it with trying to add more inputs into rotation. Also generally being organized with my layout of codes itself because I made a lot of parts for centipedes. Reason I say this is because when starting off, I didn't have an indicator/split section for each part, which may have been a headache keeping track of it. Lastly, making sure body parts do not overlap the others, since I have lots of parts, make sure one does not go over the other, which sometimes can hide from view which causes me to think code is not working itself.

		<p>
      My main goal is to take all of the inputs I did for exercise 3 and make it into a class as a whole for the very first step. Finding out which works or doesn't work for inputs for a class to original code, which makes me have an open mind of accepting what will work. Also making an array which forms a list in one group like kirby from Angie example, which all link into one, from changing size and color, but only increasing size for my centipede. Use lot’s of push() input to pop out the creature,), as well testing new sizeFactor from each every part of kirby, as well adding additional objects than 15, which add up more in total. However that very first approach to this exercise 4 was very problematic, since I put way more inputs than I needed for exercise 3 in general, causing even more stress of taking it and forming it into class. Ways I can improve forward is to step each section at a time, when I am dealing with a huge amount of code with very different actions, I try to split each one apart and take it on one by one. Overall style is random but also organized at the same time in a way, from lot’s of creatures moving,bouncing around and importing arrays factor(), as well all hold into each different class with inputs of constructor and new commands.      <br>

         <h5> Project 2/Preview </h5>
		<p>
      When picking “Recursive Tree” algorithms, my whole idea and style I wanted to make is different types of tree that have different shapes and colors throughout the day. Which heavily depends on the background image and if the tree fits with the image itself. Cause me to play a lot of different colors and transition to new parts of the tree forming throughout the video. For example in the very start of the video, the first tree fades into a frame, which follows the second layer under the first layer of leaf. Also spend lot’s of time on simply timing the transition to different, making sure the frame and certain point line up from the following tree, so not starting from the very beginning again. As well breaking and rebuilding up again, like for the middle of the video , parts of codes broke parts which circle around but I was able to compact it around the tree area. Parts I struggle with this processes is putting to much inputs that cause me unable to see normal, also be very framing, I have to limits inputs and see on much more smaller scale, than increase.
