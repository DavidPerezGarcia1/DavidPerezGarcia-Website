         <h5> Exercise 5 </h5>
		<p>
      Throughout the process for exercise 5, the overall mapping was 17, with the majority for pixels rather than text arrays. Each of the mapping showcases many different versions of my own Mario and my group mates, from basic color change to cool shapes changes and images. Even though the same outcomes may be hard to see changes or if kept the same image as basic, for example, at first it is hard to see the actual character from all image trees. For the text array, I make words related to what the array represents. For example, an item is used to shoot fire, which part of text says fire. Also use text arrays to form into shapes like how I did for normal arrays throughout the page. My other two group members are Angelique and Lyndon, each have their own array. I use the Angelique Kirby array, but for Lyndon, I picked one of his pokemon “bulbasaur” because he made so many other different kinds. Also, our overall theme is video game/nintendo, I showcase basic color look and as well with added addition for different shape,images and fading effects. The main parts I struggle with the most is to understand how to change out from for the next outcome, for example, using the array to change shape than normal but also using text array words and replacing it into shape. Which next time I have a better overall viewpoint of the general order of what should be followed, rather than mixing up new changes together. Lastly I wanted to add a cool/broken effect to stand out a lot, so I used to rotate a good amount of pretty much broken and formed into cool after effect.

         <h5> Project 3 </h5>
		<p>
      The overall approach I took for this project is to connect with one of my favorite shows called dragon ball z and give food to my cat. Which took the idea of adding one core important to the shows, which is seven dragon balls, each having a number set of stars in the ball up to seven stars. I take this symbol of dragons and make it into sets of seconds, min and hours. Each section has a different color type from other sections, this different color is not just for show but also represents moments/events during dragon ball z. For example,the cause of change to be blue/black dragon is due to many people using the dragon balls for mainly bad reasons/negative use of dragons that used to be us, which used it for good. For the left side of the screen, showcase a bowl that fills up with cat food, which goes by mill seconds, also at a certain points during hours, going pop up saying cat, eat the food now, which happens one hour during the entire 24 hours. The overall design from the dark background and white floor is me trying to remake the location that dragon balls are mostly used in the show(which is a big tower, high up in the hair). Also the green long rect in the background is me trying to show the long length of the dragon that comes from dragon balls after using it. Made parts I struggle the most is heavily trying to make counting time through limit of 7 starts, cause me to do lots of different idea of how i can 10 number in 7 number, which i end up doing overlay/stacking on top so end up representing 10 numbers
