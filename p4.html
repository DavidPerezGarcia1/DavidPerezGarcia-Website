      My main idea of for ex6 is heavy using the tools from examples that is giving and make a small little game about pushing objects away, Which I made this idea of saving the world from meteor, by letting it hit the world, it’s game over, but if you move your mouse over it, it push away the meteor which end up winning the game. I made use of scenemanger and as well p5play,clickable and p5sound throughout making ex6. Heavy made use of change of animation from two different general scenes, like fire meteor and meteor without the fire. The major issue I face is stacking up multiple changes at once, for example, by pushing  away the meteor turn off fire scene and saying game win, that part was a big issue. I kept running into errors from not inputting code in order or fixing codes, which made me do very lots of error outside of class. One way.

		<p>
Street Fighter has been one of my favorite games growing up as a kid, well played with my family, Which is why I'm taking concepts of Street Fighter into my final art project. The concept I am taking is from an older version of Street FIghter, that is the main pixels and 2D view point of slide to side action, as well as the idea of combo, combos is certain multiple inputs that create new action that is completely different from original inputs beforehand. By using these ideas, I task myself to make into two different types of software function/how overall they work, which is calculator and spelling check, like in google doc. I mainly use scene manager, Sound library and p5play throughout the process of making this project. The whole layout I wanted to make is not only to make use of the idea of fighting moves, but also random and humorous overall feeling. In splash page, make use of animation of illustration player i made, that wiggle 4 of them flailing down with use of position and reset, which play sound in background by using .isPlaying. I use this like an ice breaker of giving the viewer what this “player” can do, can it move or does it fight. On the second page is where the main action is. I heavily use and search for a build calculator, Which i use to label, time out,current input, and eval function. This calculator work as normal one, how ever, there extra step, each time press equation that is not correct on game terms, issue will show on right side of screen and make short “mad” animation of player for couple of seconds, if you use same input from before and make other equation with it, it will show you the “recipe” of two 3 inputs or other words “combo” list.  By using these, you will see two different animation scenes of the player doing kick blast and blast from its hands. Which of course follow up with changing animation function and dealing with true and false action, use of set timeout of animation lasting for 1 or few seconds. Once hovering over playing, I became mad because that's defined by the rules of the game itself, almost like the self rule of not supposed to work in that action, which of course is the mouse function. Lastly, help page, express player purpose and guide viewers of what to do. First two pages have sound but the help page does not. The viewer can focus on the instruction.      <br>
         </p>

  I feel I did capture my overall goal in terms of Street Fighter and two software calculators and spell check, however, I did face lot’s of challenges. Big issue I face is wrapping my idea around, of not only making inputs for calculators but adding additional inputs for combo and error. I test out many orders and other functions into the calculator at the same time. Parts I believe were successful overall are generally getting my idea to work. I have everything that I wanted to work from combos, error together. But parts I can improve on is generally adding more combos/visual action because I felt that most lack, which makes sense because I was so caught up with coding itself than how good I think it should look like.

<p>
  For any additional idea, my overall goal was getting this idea of Street FIghter in calculator and spelling check format, but also wanting the viewer to better understand it as myself.
